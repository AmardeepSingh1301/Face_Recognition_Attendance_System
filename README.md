# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System
Face recognition attendence system is a project in which we capture image of a person with the help on an camera and match image with the image present in our database 
(image folder) once image is detected name of the person will be displayed below it's face and a csv file with name attendence will be created which will save name and time 
of the person in it.
